    "text": "Impact of the Workflow Template\nThe introduction of the workflow template had an immediate and profound impact: - Quality of deliverables: The deliverables were structured, reliable and reproducible by anyone in the team. - Accuracy: The design accuracy was enhanced as the teams had the right tools and content to deliver to the latest global design standards. - Dramatic Reduction in Turnaround Time: Project setup time reduced from 2.5 days to 2 hours. The team could consistently finish work by 6 PM. - Minimised Support Needs: The requirement for support nearly vanished. - Scalability: The template was eventually adopted by other markets.\nThe development and implementation of this workflow template not only streamlined the ‚ÄòCustom Enterprise‚Äô team‚Äôs processes but also highlighted the importance of creating tailored solutions to meet specific team needs. This initiative significantly improved efficiency, productivity, and team satisfaction.+\nThis process was subsequently rolled out globally to India, Japan, Australia and LATAM teams. At the height of the output 80% of all desks sold outside of the USA went through this workflow."

    "section": "Solution Development: Automating Space Calculation",
    "text": "Solution Development: Automating Space Calculation\n\nUnderstanding the Requirements\nTo create a solution that truly addresses the needs of real estate professionals, we began by: - Researching BOMA Standards: Thoroughly understanding the intricacies of BOMA standards for space calculation. - Engaging with Stakeholders: Conducting interviews and surveys with real estate professionals to gather insights on their pain points and requirements.\n\n\nLeveraging Spacegraph Data Structure\nThe key to our solution was leveraging Archilogic‚Äôs Spacegraph data structure, a highly relational and data-rich representation of building spaces. This data structure allowed us to: - Automate Calculations: Use spatial data to automate space calculations accurately and consistently. - Ensure Scalability: Develop a product that could be easily scaled to different buildings and spaces. - Maintain Repeatability: Ensure the process could be repeated with the same level of accuracy every time.\n\n\nFlexibility of Standards\nAlthough we applied BOMA standards for this particular product, the underlying operations of our system are agnostic to the specific standards used. The Spacegraph data structure is designed to handle any set of space calculation standards, making the product versatile and adaptable to various industry requirements.\n\n\nBuilding the Product\nThe development process involved: - Algorithm Development: Creating algorithms to automate the space calculation process based on BOMA standards. - Integration with Spacegraph: Ensuring seamless integration with the Spacegraph data structure to utilise its relational data. - User Interface Design: Designing an intuitive user interface that allows users to easily input data and view results.\n\n\nTesting and Refinement\nWe conducted extensive testing and refinement to ensure the product met the high standards of accuracy and usability required by our users: - Beta Testing: Engaged a group of real estate professionals to test the product and provide feedback. - Iterative Improvements: Made iterative improvements based on user feedback to enhance functionality and user experience.\n\n\nGraph Structure Operation\nThe Spacegraph data structure operates by determining whether lines are drawn at the inner, centre, or outer edge of spaces, depending on the use of the space on either side. This approach minimises human error and subjectivity, ensuring that calculations are consistent and reliable."

With studios across the UK, Europe, and the Middle East, they specialize in diverse sectors including aviation, education, healthcare, and leisure. Their collaborative approach ensures each project reflects the client‚Äôs vision, creating impactful spaces that serve communities. Pascall+Watson is committed to environmental and social responsibility, continually pushing the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible in architecture and design.\n\nDue to the confidential nature of this project, information shared here is limited to what is publicly available.\n\nAddressing the Uniquely Challenging Nature of London City Airport\nLondon City Airport stands out as a uniquely challenging site and project for several reasons:\n\nLocation Constraints:\n\nUrban Setting: Located in the heart of London, the airport is surrounded by residential and commercial buildings. This urban setting imposes strict noise and height restrictions, demanding innovative design and operational strategies.\nLimited Space: The airport is built on a relatively small footprint compared to other major airports. This limitation requires efficient space utilization for runways, taxiways, terminals, and other facilities.\n\nOperational Complexity:\n\nShort Runway: The airport has one of the shortest commercial runways in the world, at just 1,508 meters (4,948 feet). This necessitates precise and careful landing and takeoff procedures, often requiring aircraft modifications and specialized pilot training.\n\nRegulatory and Community Engagement:\n\nStrict Regulations: Operating within one of the world‚Äôs most regulated airspaces means compliance with numerous aviation, safety, and environmental regulations. Navigating these regulations while maintaining efficient operations requires meticulous planning and execution.\nCommunity Relations: The airport must actively engage with the local community to address concerns related to noise, traffic, and environmental impact. Building and maintaining good relations with the community is vital for its ongoing operations and potential expansion projects.\n\nInnovative Solutions:\n\nTechnological Advancements: To address these challenges, the airport incorporates state-of-the-art technologies in air traffic management, security, and passenger services. Innovations such as remote air traffic control towers and biometric boarding systems are part of its strategy to enhance efficiency and passenger experience.\nInfrastructure Upgrades: Continuous infrastructure upgrades are essential to meet growing demand and evolving regulatory standards. Projects like terminal expansions, runway enhancements, and improved transportation links are critical to maintaining the airport‚Äôs competitive edge.\n\n\n\n\n\nmodel overview\n\n\n\n\n\nmodel overview\n\n\n\n\n\nmodel overview\n\n\n\n\nCoordination and collaboration\n\n\n\nmodelBreakdown\n\n\n\n\n\nPAW-LCA-planning-plans\n\n\n\n\n\nPAW-LCA-planning-plans\n\n\n\n\n\nPAW-LCA-planning-plans\n\n\n\n\nDigital Air Traffic Control Tower\nPascall+Watson‚Äôs remote air traffic control tower is world-first for a major international airport &gt; London City Airport has introduced the UK‚Äôs first digital air traffic control tower, a significant development in its ¬£400 million redevelopment program. This state-of-the-art tower allows controllers to manage air traffic remotely using high-definition cameras and sensors, providing a 360-degree view of the airfield from a control center located over 70 miles away.
