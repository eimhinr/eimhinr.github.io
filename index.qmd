👋 Hello

I'm Eimhin Rafferty

With over 4 years of direct experience in product management, I have delivered genre-defining products and ambitious programmes at the intersection of technology and the built environment. This builds on a foundation of 10 years of experience in delivering a broad portfolio of design and construction projects globally.

My architectural background equips me with meticulous attention to detail, strong problem-solving skills, and the ability to communicate complex ideas clearly and concisely to both technical and non-technical audiences. I excel in cross-functional teams, am passionate about user-centric design, and possess a wide-angle lens for identifying and addressing complex challenges.

With patience and empathy, I foster strong relationships, build consensus, and drive projects to successful completion.
