This project enhanced efficiency and accuracy, improved data security, and streamlined workflows.\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 29, 2024\n\n\nEimhin Rafferty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtecting 3.7 TB of Project Data: The BIM 360 Data Migration Initiative\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeWork\n\n\nProgramme Management\n\n\nOperations\n\n\nCase Study\n\n\n\nThe BIM 360 Data Migration project addresses the challenge of managing 3.7 TB of project data stored in a locked in cloud platform - ‚ÄòBIM 360 Teams‚Äô which became inaccessible as versions of Autodesk Revit 2017/2018 were phased out. This migration ensureed that all project data moved to the sucessor, ‚ÄòBIM 360 Docs‚Äô, upgrading models to the latest Revit versions and maintaining user access throughout the process.\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 28, 2024\n\n\nEimhin Rafferty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase Study: Automating Floor Plan Polylining and Integration with IWMS Platforms\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArchilogic\n\n\nProduct Management\n\n\nCase Study\n\n\nIntegrations\n\n\n\nAs a Product Manager at Archilogic, I led the development and integration of a solution to automate floor plan updates for customers, addressing a major pain point: keeping floor plans updated across multiple platforms, particularly their Integrated Workplace Management Systems (IWMS). This case study details how we collaborated with customers using FM Systems, developed automation for polyline creation, integrated our solution with IWMS platforms, and ultimately built a native app plugin for seamless data transfer.\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 27, 2024\n\n\nEimhin Rafferty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase Study: Transforming Design Technology Support at WeWork\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeWork\n\n\nProgramme Management\n\n\nCase Study\n\n\n\nAs a Design Technology Product Manager at WeWork, I spearheaded a critical initiative to overhaul the support process for our design technology teams. Recognizing the need for a systematic approach to support as our teams grew leaner and more remote, I led the design, implementation, and operationalization of a comprehensive Jira-based ticketing system. This project highlighted themes of empathy, accountability, accuracy, and cross-functional leadership, ensuring fair and transparent support for all teams.\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 26, 2024\n\n\nEimhin Rafferty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeWork Self Serve Platform: Enhancing Access and Security\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeWork\n\n\nProduct Management\n\n\nCase Study\n\n\n\nTo address significant bottlenecks and security issues, I led the design and development of a self-serve web app integrated with Autodesk Construction Cloud. This platform revolutionized how our global design team accessed and managed 3D models of WeWork‚Äôs 550 buildings and 2500 floors, ensuring both security and efficiency.\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 25, 2024\n\n\nEimhin Rafferty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeveloping a Workflow Template for the Custom Enterprise Team\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeWork\n\n\nProduct Management\n\n\nCase Study\n\n\nArchitecture\n\n\n\nAt WeWork, I was tasked with supporting a newly formed ‚ÄòCustom Enterprise‚Äô team within the Sales Organisation. This team of six designers was responsible for rapidly creating sales collateral for various buildings in our portfolio. Assembled on an ad-hoc basis and not reporting to the main design organisation, they faced significant operational challenges.\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 23, 2024\n\n\nEimhin Rafferty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHandling a Global Software Failure: A Case Study\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeWork\n\n\nProgramme Management\n\n\nOperations\n\n\nCase Study\n\n\n\nDuring a global software failure, I led the resolution efforts across multiple regions, including Japan, Asia, EMEA, LATAM, and North America. The issue was initially reported by a user in Japan and quickly spread to other regions. Coordinating with network engineers and resellers, I gathered detailed information from users and kept stakeholders informed throughout the process. By developing PowerShell scripts and SOPs for a complex uninstall process, and leveraging VP support to navigate legal restrictions, I ensured minimal downtime and restored normal operations efficiently.\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 22, 2024\n\n\nEimhin Rafferty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutomating Space Calculation: A Case Study on Leading Innovation in Real Estate with Archilogic\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArchilogic\n\n\nProduct Management\n\n\nCase Study\n\n\n\nAs a Product Manager at Archilogic, I led the development of a groundbreaking product that automates space calculations based on BOMA standards. This product leverages the power of our Spacegraph data structure, making it scalable, repeatable, and uniquely effective due to the relational nature of the underlying data.\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 21, 2024\n\n\nEimhin Rafferty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase Study: Enabling Multiple Layouts at Archilogic\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArchilogic\n\n\nProduct Management\n\n\nCase Study\n\n\nIntegrations\n\n\n\nIn Archilogic, I led a transformative project called ‚ÄòEnable Multiple Layouts.‚Äô This initiative aimed to allow users to create, review, and implement different layout options for building floors without disrupting the main production environment. The project involved significant technical complexity, including new API implementations and enhancements to our space graph data structure.\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 20, 2024\n\n\nEimhin Rafferty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase Study: Implementing Design Standards for EMEA - A Design Technology Product Management Initiative at WeWork\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeWork\n\n\nProduct Management\n\n\nCase Study\n\n\nArchitecture\n\n\n\nAs a Design Technology Product Manager at WeWork, I led a high-impact project to translate global design standards into actionable content, processes, and training systems for teams in EMEA. This initiative was configured to address local needs, supply chain demands, and building regulations, ensuring consistency and compliance across the region.\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 19, 2024\n\n\nEimhin Rafferty\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "text": "Pascall + Watson ‚Ä¢ Building Information Model Coordinator\n11/2016 - 07/2018\n\nPascall+Watson Architects, founded in 1956, is an international architecture and design firm known for its innovative and sustainable solutions. With studios across the UK, Europe, and the Middle East, they specialize in diverse sectors including aviation, education, healthcare, and leisure. Their collaborative approach ensures each project reflects the client‚Äôs vision, creating impactful spaces that serve communities. Pascall+Watson is committed to environmental and social responsibility, continually pushing the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible in architecture and design.\n\nDue to the confidential nature of this project, information shared here is limited to what is publicly available.\n\nAddressing the Uniquely Challenging Nature of London City Airport\nLondon City Airport stands out as a uniquely challenging site and project for several reasons:\n\nLocation Constraints:\n\nUrban Setting: Located in the heart of London, the airport is surrounded by residential and commercial buildings. This urban setting imposes strict noise and height restrictions, demanding innovative design and operational strategies.\nLimited Space: The airport is built on a relatively small footprint compared to other major airports. This limitation requires efficient space utilization for runways, taxiways, terminals, and other facilities.\n\nOperational Complexity:\n\nShort Runway: The airport has one of the shortest commercial runways in the world, at just 1,508 meters (4,948 feet). This necessitates precise and careful landing and takeoff procedures, often requiring aircraft modifications and specialized pilot training.\n\nRegulatory and Community Engagement:\n\nStrict Regulations: Operating within one of the world‚Äôs most regulated airspaces means compliance with numerous aviation, safety, and environmental regulations. Navigating these regulations while maintaining efficient operations requires meticulous planning and execution.\nCommunity Relations: The airport must actively engage with the local community to address concerns related to noise, traffic, and environmental impact. Building and maintaining good relations with the community is vital for its ongoing operations and potential expansion projects.\n\nInnovative Solutions:\n\nTechnological Advancements: To address these challenges, the airport incorporates state-of-the-art technologies in air traffic management, security, and passenger services. Innovations such as remote air traffic control towers and biometric boarding systems are part of its strategy to enhance efficiency and passenger experience.\nInfrastructure Upgrades: Continuous infrastructure upgrades are essential to meet growing demand and evolving regulatory standards. Projects like terminal expansions, runway enhancements, and improved transportation links are critical to maintaining the airport‚Äôs competitive edge.\n\n\n\n\n\nmodel overview\n\n\n\n\n\nmodel overview\n\n\n\n\n\nmodel overview\n\n\n\n\nCoordination and collaboration\n\n\n\nmodelBreakdown\n\n\n\n\n\nPAW-LCA-planning-plans\n\n\n\n\n\nPAW-LCA-planning-plans\n\n\n\n\n\nPAW-LCA-planning-plans\n\n\n\n\nDigital Air Traffic Control Tower\nPascall+Watson‚Äôs remote air traffic control tower is world-first for a major international airport &gt; London City Airport has introduced the UK‚Äôs first digital air traffic control tower, a significant development in its ¬£400 million redevelopment program. This state-of-the-art tower allows controllers to manage air traffic remotely using high-definition cameras and sensors, providing a 360-degree view of the airfield from a control center located over 70 miles away. This innovative approach enhances operational efficiency and safety, marking a transformative step in airport technology \n\n\nBIM Coordination\n\n\n\nPAW_coord_collab\n\n\n\n\n\nPAW_coord_collab\n\n\n\n\n\nPAW_coord_collab\n\n\n\n\nDelivering Classifications, COBie and Efficncies with Dynamo\n\n\n\nPAW-Data-Code\n\n\n\n\n\nPAW-Data-Code\n\n\n\n\n\nPAW-Data-Code\n\n\n\n\n\nPAW-Data-Code"

    "title": "WeWork Self Serve Platform: Enhancing Access and Security",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Background:\nWeWork‚Äôs Record Model initiative created a protected digital and verified data set of 3D, data-rich models for over 550 buildings, encompassing 2500 floors. However, the existing platform, where every user had admin rights, became a significant bottleneck. It allowed users to add themselves or others to projects, override read-only protections, and view any project, raising privacy and security concerns.\nOld System Issues:\n\nAdmin Rights for All: Every user having admin privileges meant uncontrolled access, leading to potential overwriting of crucial data.\nPrivacy Risks: Users could access any project on the platform, compromising sensitive information and raising security issues.\n\nNew Solution: To address these issues, I spearheaded the development of a self-serve web application integrated with Autodesk Construction Cloud. This app allowed users to:\n\nDownload Locally: Users could access the latest file or recreate it in a new cloud directory, ensuring read-only access outside the main platform, which protects the integrity of the original data.\nIterate Designs: The design team could work on a ‚Äòforked‚Äô file, enabling them to share with customers, iterate designs, or update based on real-world conditions without impacting the business-critical data.\nVerified Submissions: Changes could be submitted and verified through record model workflows, ensuring all modifications were tracked.\nControlled Access: The Okta SSO system managed user access, ensuring only authorized personnel could make changes.\n\nImplementation Steps:\n\nProblem Validation: I demonstrated the severity of the issue to corporate tech, infosec, and product leadership, gaining their buy-in.\nCost Assignment: Highlighted the time spent on managing permissions and the potential damage to projects due to unauthorized changes.\nCost-Benefit Analysis: Showed that reducing the license pool to essential users for file sharing would lower costs and improve security.\nRisk Reporting: Emphasized the risk of not addressing the issue, including potential damage to validated structures, which were part of a multi-million dollar project.\n\nKey tools I used:\n\nLucidchart for Wireframe, Workflow Diagrams\nGoogle docs for PRD, Sheets for tracking budgets\nSlack for general communicaiton, dedicated channel to keep teams synced.\nMonday.com for managing & tracking tasks\n\nProject Development:\n\nDeveloped a PRD, workflow diagrams, wireframes, and other product artifacts.\nTendered the project to external specialist teams experienced in the AEC space.\nSecured the necessary budget and vetted the selected delivery team through infosec and vendor management.\nManaged the project to completion, coordinating code reviews with infosec, and ensuring SSO integration and hosting were finalized.\nConducted user training and provided comprehensive documentation before the app‚Äôs launch.\n\nOutcome:\nThe self-serve platform significantly enhanced access and security for WeWork‚Äôs global design team and customers. By addressing the bottlenecks and security issues of the old system, I ensured that only authorized users could access and modify the critical 3D models. This project demonstrated my ability to identify critical issues, secure stakeholder support, and deliver effective, scalable solutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutomating Space Calculation: A Case Study on Leading Innovation in Real Estate with Archilogic\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a Product Manager at Archilogic, I led the development of a groundbreaking product that automates space calculations based on BOMA standards.

We then developed a solution to automate the creation of polylines for assets and spaces based on predefined rules and custom attribute information that teams could easily input. This involved:\n\nRules and Attributes: Defining rules and custom attributes to automate polyline creation for different assets and spaces.\nIterative Refinement: Working iteratively with customers to refine these standards and ensure the solution met their requirements.\nError Detection: Identifying and correcting errors in their manual processes, reducing human error. This reporting gave a sharp boost in confidence in the quality of our product.\n\n\n\nAccurate Area Calculations\nOur solution provided accurate calculations for overall areas (USF) and internal space areas for reservable spaces. This included desks and chair combinations within open workspaces, which were labelled and exported as SVG files, all within the correctly defined drawing layers.\n\n\nIntegration with IWMS\nThe next step was integrating this automated solution with the IWMS platform. This involved:\n\nCollaboration with Technical Teams: Working closely with the technical teams of IWMS platforms to understand their requirements and constraints.\nAccessing Private APIs: Gaining access to private APIs to facilitate seamless integration.\nDeconstructing Proprietary File Formats: Analyzing and deconstructing proprietary file formats used by IWMS platforms, which turned out to be a zip file containing CSV data files and an SVG file of their plans and polylines.\n\n\n\nNative App Plugin Development\nTo further streamline the process, we built this functionality into our native app as a plugin. This allowed customers to:\n\nSeamless Data Transfer: Directly send their updated data to IWMS as they updated the app.\nReal-Time Updates: Ensure their floor plans were always current without the need for manual intervention."

This model served as the foundation for our standardisation efforts.\n\n\nCross-Functional Coordination\nSuccessfully translating the design standards required extensive coordination between various stakeholders, including:\n\nConstruction Project Managers: To ensure that the designs were feasible and could be implemented on-site.\nDesign Teams: To maintain the integrity and vision of the original design standards.\nSourcing and Supply Chain Teams: To ensure that all materials met the required standards and were available when needed. WeWork relied heavily on bulk orders and warehousing so this was a key driver of suppily chain issues in all regions.\nCost Managers: To keep the standards within budget while meeting all design specifications, not all regions were equal in this regard.\nElectrical Engineers: To ensure that all electrical and lighting configurations were accurate and complied with local regulations.\nArchitects: Any default configuratoins which impacted local building laws needed to be amended, noted or removed as needed.\n\n\n\n\noutput document\n\n\n\n\nInitial Rollout and Feedback\nThe content was initially rolled out to small teams to gather feedback. This phased approach allowed us to make iterative improvements based on real-world usage and ensure the elements met the specific needs of various stakeholders.\n\n\nTooling and Quality Control\nSpecific tooling and utilities were created to ensure quality control and compliance with the master source content. These tools allowed us to quickly identify and rectify any deviations from the standards once the content was used in the field.\n\n\nOnboarding and Training\nWe onboarded teams across the EMEA region, providing comprehensive training to ensure they could effectively use the new standards and tools. The success of this initial rollout led to the extension of the programme to third-party teams used by WeWork."

    "text": "Background:\nWeWork‚Äôs Record Model initiative created a protected digital and verified data set of 3D, data-rich models for over 550 buildings, encompassing 2500 floors. However, the existing platform, where every user had admin rights, became a significant bottleneck. It allowed users to add themselves or others to projects, override read-only protections, and view any project, raising privacy and security concerns.\nOld System Issues:\n\nAdmin Rights for All: Every user having admin privileges meant uncontrolled access, leading to potential overwriting of crucial data.\nPrivacy Risks: Users could access any project on the platform, compromising sensitive information and raising security issues.\n\nNew Solution: To address these issues, I spearheaded the development of a self-serve web application integrated with Autodesk Construction Cloud. This app allowed users to:\n\nDownload Locally: Users could access the latest file or recreate it in a new cloud directory, ensuring read-only access outside the main platform, which protects the integrity of the original data.\nIterate Designs: The design team could work on a ‚Äòforked‚Äô file, enabling them to share with customers, iterate designs, or update based on real-world conditions without impacting the business-critical data.\nVerified Submissions: Changes could be submitted and verified through record model workflows, ensuring all modifications were tracked.\nControlled Access: The Okta SSO system managed user access, ensuring only authorized personnel could make changes.\n\nImplementation Steps:\n\nProblem Validation: I demonstrated the severity of the issue to corporate tech, infosec, and product leadership, gaining their buy-in.\nCost Assignment: Highlighted the time spent on managing permissions and the potential damage to projects due to unauthorized changes.\nCost-Benefit Analysis: Showed that reducing the license pool to essential users for file sharing would lower costs and improve security.\nRisk Reporting: Emphasized the risk of not addressing the issue, including potential damage to validated structures, which were part of a multi-million dollar project.\n\nKey tools I used:\n\nLucidchart for Wireframe, Workflow Diagrams\nGoogle docs for PRD, Sheets for tracking budgets\nSlack for general communicaiton, dedicated channel to keep teams synced.\nMonday.com for managing & tracking tasks\n\nProject Development:\n\nDeveloped a PRD, workflow diagrams, wireframes, and other product artifacts.\nTendered the project to external specialist teams experienced in the AEC space.\nSecured the necessary budget and vetted the selected delivery team through infosec and vendor management.\nManaged the project to completion, coordinating code reviews with infosec, and ensuring SSO integration and hosting were finalized.\nConducted user training and provided comprehensive documentation before the app‚Äôs launch.\n\nOutcome:\nThe self-serve platform significantly enhanced access and security for WeWork‚Äôs global design team and customers.

    "section": "Solution Development: Automating Space Calculation",
    "text": "Solution Development: Automating Space Calculation\n\nUnderstanding the Requirements\nTo create a solution that truly addresses the needs of real estate professionals, we began by:\n\nResearching BOMA Standards: Thoroughly understanding the intricacies of BOMA standards for space calculation.\nEngaging with Stakeholders: Conducting interviews and surveys with real estate professionals to gather insights on their pain points and requirements.\n\n\n\nLeveraging Spacegraph Data Structure\nThe key to our solution was leveraging Archilogic‚Äôs Spacegraph data structure, a highly relational and data-rich representation of building spaces. This data structure allowed us to:\n\nAutomate Calculations: Use spatial data to automate space calculations accurately and consistently.\nEnsure Scalability: Develop a product that could be easily scaled to different buildings and spaces.\nMaintain Repeatability: Ensure the process could be repeated with the same level of accuracy every time.\n\n\n\nFlexibility of Standards\nAlthough we applied BOMA standards for this particular product, the underlying operations of our system are agnostic to the specific standards used. The Spacegraph data structure is designed to handle any set of space calculation standards, making the product versatile and adaptable to various industry requirements.\n\n\nBuilding the Product\nThe development process involved:\n\nAlgorithm Development: Creating algorithms to automate the space calculation process based on BOMA standards.\nIntegration with Spacegraph: Ensuring seamless integration with the Spacegraph data structure to utilise its relational data.\nUser Interface Design: Designing an intuitive user interface that allows users to easily input data and view results.\n\n\n\nTesting and Refinement\nWe conducted extensive testing and refinement to ensure the product met the high standards of accuracy and usability required by our users:\n\nBeta Testing: Engaged a group of real estate professionals to test the product and provide feedback.\nIterative Improvements: Made iterative improvements based on user feedback to enhance functionality and user experience.\n\n\n\nGraph Structure Operation\nThe Spacegraph data structure operates by determining whether lines are drawn at the inner, centre, or outer edge of spaces, depending on the use of the space on either side. This approach minimises human error and subjectivity, ensuring that calculations are consistent and reliable.\n\n\nDemo"

Recognizing the need for a systematic approach to support as our teams grew leaner and more remote, I led the design, implementation, and operationalization of a comprehensive Jira-based ticketing system. This project highlighted themes of empathy, accountability, accuracy, and cross-functional leadership, ensuring fair and transparent support for all teams globally who relied on fair access to the Design Technology Group.\n\n\n\nIn an increasingly remote and decentralized work environment, the existing informal support processes were proving inadequate. Support requests were often lost in Slack messages, leading to frustration and inefficiency. Recognizing this gap, I identified the need for a structured support system to ensure that all teams, regardless of location, received equal and timely support.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the critical nature of this transformation, I communicated the importance of a formal ticketing system to leadership and my teammates. I emphasized how this system would:\n\nImprove time management, allowing focused work on other key pillars such as content, process, and training.\nEnsure fairness, with remote teams receiving the same level of support as those co-located.\nEnhance accountability through the introduction of Service Level Agreements (SLAs).\nProvide a clear escalation path to demonstrate recurring issues to VPs, facilitating investment in underlying solutions.\n\n\n\n\nWith buy-in from leadership and the team, I designed the Jira-based ticketing system with the following features:\n\nEfficacy: Better management of our time and resources.\nFairness: Ensured that no message got lost and that remote teams had equal access to support.\nAccountability: Introduced SLAs to track and measure response times.\nEscalation: Enabled transparent escalation of issues to other departments such as IT, Technology, Finance, and Operations.\nStandard Operating Procedures: Created structured responses for common issues to streamline support processes.\n\n\n\n\nI worked closely with the team to document the new system and conducted training sessions to ensure everyone was comfortable with the new processes. We launched the system locally first, allowing us to refine it based on initial feedback before rolling it out globally in a phased manner.\n\n\n\nTo ensure adoption, I demonstrated the direct benefits of the new system to users, educating them on how it would improve their work experience. I established formal support pipelines with other technology and building support teams, creating a two-way communication channel that was transparent and accountable.\n\n\n\nThe implementation of the Jira-based ticketing system had several key outcomes:\n\nImproved Efficiency: Teams were able to manage their time better and focus on high-priority tasks.\nEnhanced Fairness: Remote teams received the same level of support as those in the same building, fostering a more inclusive work environment.\nGreater Accountability: The introduction of SLAs ensured that support requests were tracked and resolved in a timely manner.\nEffective Escalation: The system provided evidence of recurring issues, enabling leadership to make informed decisions about resource allocation and investment.\nStandardized Processes: The creation of SOPs streamlined support responses, making the process more predictable and reliable.\n\n\n\n\nThe transformation of the design technology support process at WeWork was a testament to effective programme management, characterized by empathy, accountability, accuracy, and cross-functional leadership. By identifying a critical need, securing buy-in from stakeholders, and implementing a robust solution, I was able to operationalize a system that significantly improved the efficiency and reliability of support for our design teams. This project not only met immediate needs but also laid the groundwork for continued improvement and scalability in our support processes."

    "text": "Execution\n\nDevelopment of Data-Rich Elements\nWe created over 1,000 data-rich elements encapsulated in a self-documenting container model. Each element was meticulously maintained, versioned, and fully annotated to ensure clarity and usability. This model served as the foundation for our standardisation efforts.\n\n\nCross-Functional Coordination\nSuccessfully translating the design standards required extensive coordination between various stakeholders, including:\n\nConstruction Project Managers: To ensure that the designs were feasible and could be implemented on-site.\nDesign Teams: To maintain the integrity and vision of the original design standards.\nSourcing and Supply Chain Teams: To ensure that all materials met the required standards and were available when needed. WeWork relied heavily on bulk orders and warehousing so this was a key driver of suppily chain issues in all regions.\nCost Managers: To keep the standards within budget while meeting all design specifications, not all regions were equal in this regard.\nElectrical Engineers: To ensure that all electrical and lighting configurations were accurate and complied with local regulations.\nArchitects: Any default configuratoins which impacted local building laws needed to be amended, noted or removed as needed.\n\n\n\n\noutput document\n\n\n\n\nInitial Rollout and Feedback\nThe content was initially rolled out to small teams to gather feedback. This phased approach allowed us to make iterative improvements based on real-world usage and ensure the elements met the specific needs of various stakeholders.\n\n\nTooling and Quality Control\nSpecific tooling and utilities were created to ensure quality control and compliance with the master source content. These tools allowed us to quickly identify and rectify any deviations from the standards once the content was used in the field.\n\n\nOnboarding and Training\nWe onboarded teams across the EMEA region, providing comprehensive training to ensure they could effectively use the new standards and tools. The success of this initial rollout led to the extension of the programme to third-party teams used by WeWork."
