### BIM at WeWork

> WeWork uses Autodesk building information modeling
(BIM) software throughout the building lifecycle to help
keep pace with the growing demand for collaborative
office space around the world.

#### Reality Capture - BIM for existing conditions

Capturing accurate as-built data as the first step of design

> WeWork uses reality capture and BIM solutions to support the design and construction of its WeWork offices, including ReCap, Revit, and Dynamo software. The firm uses 3D laser scanners to capture the existing conditions of a newly acquired space. The resulting point clouds are combined and edited in ReCap to visualize and navigate the existing conditions data.
> This data is used in Revit to guide WeWork's modeling efforts as it develops a series of design options. The firm uses Dynamo and Revit API to embed cost and sales data from its business systems in the models in order to analyze revenue versus cost and other key business metrics.

![WeWork_](assets/WeWork/WeWork-PointCloud-Coordination.png)

#### Tooled up BIM, PyRevit, Dynamo, Google Apps Scripts

> As the design progresses, WeWork scans the space and references that data to quickly generate a more detailed design model and coordinate its design with existing structure and services. This highly-coordinated, precise 3D model offers increased use of prefabrication and offsite assembly, helping to minimize onsite rework and avoid delays during construction.
> In addition, the intelligent Revit design model drives WeWork’s supply chain. With Revit, the project team is able to produce all of their drawings and quantities automatically, so all estimating and bidding is based on the design model and surprises are minimized during construction.

### Addressing the Uniquely Challenging Nature of London City Airport

London City Airport stands out as a uniquely challenging site and project for several reasons:

1. **Location Constraints**:
   - **Urban Setting**: Located in the heart of London, the airport is surrounded by residential and commercial buildings. This urban setting imposes strict noise and height restrictions, demanding innovative design and operational strategies.
   - **Limited Space**: The airport is built on a relatively small footprint compared to other major airports. This limitation requires efficient space utilization for runways, taxiways, terminals, and other facilities.

2. **Operational Complexity**:
   - **Short Runway**: The airport has one of the shortest commercial runways in the world, at just 1,508 meters (4,948 feet). This necessitates precise and careful landing and takeoff procedures, often requiring aircraft modifications and specialized pilot training.

3. **Regulatory and Community Engagement**:
   - **Strict Regulations**: Operating within one of the world’s most regulated airspaces means compliance with numerous aviation, safety, and environmental regulations. Navigating these regulations while maintaining efficient operations requires meticulous planning and execution.
   - **Community Relations**: The airport must actively engage with the local community to address concerns related to noise, traffic, and environmental impact. Building and maintaining good relations with the community is vital for its ongoing operations and potential expansion projects.

4. **Innovative Solutions**:
   - **Technological Advancements**: To address these challenges, the airport incorporates state-of-the-art technologies in air traffic management, security, and passenger services. Innovations such as remote air traffic control towers and biometric boarding systems are part of its strategy to enhance efficiency and passenger experience.
   - **Infrastructure Upgrades**: Continuous infrastructure upgrades are essential to meet growing demand and evolving regulatory standards. Projects like terminal expansions, runway enhancements, and improved transportation links are critical to maintaining the airport’s competitive edge.

### Digital Air Traffic Control Tower
[Pascall+Watson's remote air traffic control tower is world-first for a major international airport](https://www.pascalls.co.uk/news/article/pascallwatsons-remote-air-traffic-control-tower-is-world-first-for-a-major-international-airport/)
> London City Airport has introduced the UK's first digital air traffic control tower, a significant development in its £400 million redevelopment program. This state-of-the-art tower allows controllers to manage air traffic remotely using high-definition cameras and sensors, providing a 360-degree view of the airfield from a control center located over 70 miles away. This innovative approach enhances operational efficiency and safety, marking a transformative step in airport technology
