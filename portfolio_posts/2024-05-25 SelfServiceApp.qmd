**Background:**  

WeWork's Record Model initiative created a protected digital and verified data set of 3D, data-rich models for over 550 buildings, encompassing 2500 floors. However, the existing platform, where every user had admin rights, became a significant bottleneck. It allowed users to add themselves or others to projects, override read-only protections, and view any project, raising privacy and security concerns.

**Old System Issues:**

- **Admin Rights for All:** Every user having admin privileges meant uncontrolled access, leading to potential overwriting of crucial data.
- **Privacy Risks:** Users could access any project on the platform, compromising sensitive information and raising security issues.

**New Solution:**
To address these issues, I spearheaded the development of a self-serve web application integrated with Autodesk Construction Cloud. This app allowed users to:

- **Download Locally:** Users could access the latest file or recreate it in a new cloud directory, ensuring read-only access outside the main platform, which protects the integrity of the original data.
- **Iterate Designs:** The design team could work on a 'forked' file, enabling them to share with customers, iterate designs, or update based on real-world conditions without impacting the business-critical data.
- **Verified Submissions:** Changes could be submitted and verified through record model workflows, ensuring all modifications were tracked.
- **Controlled Access:** The Okta SSO system managed user access, ensuring only authorized personnel could make changes.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Problem Validation:** I demonstrated the severity of the issue to corporate tech, infosec, and product leadership, gaining their buy-in.
2. **Cost Assignment:** Highlighted the time spent on managing permissions and the potential damage to projects due to unauthorized changes.
3. **Cost-Benefit Analysis:** Showed that reducing the license pool to essential users for file sharing would lower costs and improve security.
4. **Risk Reporting:** Emphasized the risk of not addressing the issue, including potential damage to validated structures, which were part of a multi-million dollar project.

Key tools I used: 

- Lucidchart for Wireframe, Workflow Diagrams 
- Google docs for PRD, Sheets for tracking budgets 
- Slack for general communicaiton, dedicated channel to keep teams synced. 
- Monday.com for managing & tracking tasks

**Project Development:**

- Developed a PRD, workflow diagrams, wireframes, and other product artifacts.
- Tendered the project to external specialist teams experienced in the AEC space.
- Secured the necessary budget and vetted the selected delivery team through infosec and vendor management.
- Managed the project to completion, coordinating code reviews with infosec, and ensuring SSO integration and hosting were finalized.
- Conducted user training and provided comprehensive documentation before the app's launch.

**Outcome:**  
The self-serve platform significantly enhanced access and security for WeWork's global design team and customers. By addressing the bottlenecks and security issues of the old system, I ensured that only authorized users could access and modify the critical 3D models. This project demonstrated my ability to identify critical issues, secure stakeholder support, and deliver effective, scalable solutions.
