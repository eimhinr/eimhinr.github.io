# Streamlining 3.7 TB of Project Data: The BIM 360 Data Migration Initiative

## Overview

The BIM 360 Data Migration project addresses the challenge of managing 3.7 TB of project data stored in BIM 360 Teams, which will become inaccessible as Revit 2017/2018 phases out. This migration ensures that all project data moves to BIM 360 Docs, upgrading models to the latest Revit versions and maintaining user access throughout the process.

## Objectives

1. **Data Transfer**: Move all project data from BIM 360 Teams to BIM 360 Docs.
2. **Model Upgrade**: Upgrade EC, Layout, and AOR Revit models to the latest versions.
3. **Access Maintenance**: Ensure continuous access for users to the migrated projects.
4. **Access Tracking**: Maintain records of external access to projects in BIM 360 Teams.

## Challenges

## Data Storage and Revit Versions

- Data spans multiple platforms: BIM 360 Team, BIM 360 Docs, and W: Drive.
- Various Revit versions are used, with Revit 2017 access ending by Q1 2021, impacting a significant number of projects.

### Projects at Risk

- 317 projects using Revit <2016, 340 projects using Revit 2018, and 36 projects using Revit 2019 or later are at risk due to version phase-out and storage limitations.

### Stage 1: Data Transfer

- Move Revit models, CADs, point clouds, and relevant files to BIM 360 Docs.

### Stage 2: Model Upgrade

- Upgrade all Revit models to the latest version (2019).
- Unzip and organize composite design models.
  
### Stage 3: Model Activation

- Convert necessary Revit models to cloud collaboration models for design teams.
  
## Automation and Management

- A Forge API Python library automates data transfer, model upgrades, and collaboration tasks.
- Airtable is used to manage data and project information efficiently.

## Workflow

1. **Transfer**: Move files to an ARCHIVE folder in BIM 360 Docs.
2. **Unzip**: Unzip composite Revit models.
3. **Upgrade**: Use the Design Automation Forge API for remote upgrades.
4. **Collaborate**: Manually collaborate and link files in BIM 360 Docs.

## Ongoing process improvement 

1. **Code Refinement**: Improve version comparison, display name handling, and async processing.
2. **Management Transition**: Move project management from Airtable to Sheets.
3. **Process Consolidation**: Integrate unzip/upgrade processes and enhance performance.
4. **Dashboard Development**: Create a progress dashboard for real-time tracking and stakeholder updates.

## Key Milestones

- **Initial EMEA Release**: Establish transfer management and validation framework.
- **Speed Improvements**: Implement AWS Lambda for efficient file transfer and remote upgrades.
- **Global Release**: Expand process management globally and develop a reporting dashboard.
- **Process Refinement**: Consolidate and integrate unzip/upgrade processes into the management system.

By successfully executing this migration, the project ensures that WeWork's data remains accessible, updated, and efficiently managed across the latest BIM 360 platforms.
